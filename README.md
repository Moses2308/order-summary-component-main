## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- This project taught me about the background-repeat property. I knew about this property prior to this project, but had forgotton. I also had never used the repeat-x value. This project reinforced my knowledge of this because I had to look it up. I went to MDN and looked up the background-repeat property to learn about its values and how I could use it for this project
- This project also taught me that I can have both a background-image and a background-color. I previously only thought that only one could be present.
- I also learned the struggles of working in a non-linear pattern. Working on one component and switching to another made it difficult when styling. As a result, my code ended up being a bit messier than I would've liked. From now on I will try my best to work in a top down approach.
- This project also reinforced my knowledge of media queries, and responsive design. I used a media query to switch the background when growing to the desktop view, and I used min-widths and max widths so that the components could grow with the screen to  the appropriate size.

### Continued development

In this project I struggled keeping my classes and stylesheet organized. In the future I'd like to restrict myself a bit more to a top down approach to stying components so that I can get a solid foundation. Maybe in the future I will be able to break out of this structure and work more fluidly.

I would also like to work more with semantic elements. Currently, I use them very sparringly. Soon, I'd like to be able to incorperate semantic HTML in all the necessary areas.

Expanding my knowledge of grid and putting it into practice more is another one of my goals.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This site always helps me when my memory of a topic is a bit hazy. It provides wonderful examples and definitions so that it can jog my memory, and i can get back to work.
